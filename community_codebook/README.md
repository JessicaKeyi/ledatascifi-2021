## Bug fixes, feature improvements, and new recipe suggestions are "participation" for the purposes of grades 

We will put any functions or recipes we develop here, when we find ourselves doing stuff repeatedly.

The recipes and functions should be considered "under development". If you have ideas to improve these functions, 
1. clone this repo to your computer
2. modify the functions
3. submit your modifications (as a pull request, GH Desktop should handle the specifics for you)

If the last step doesn't work, please let me know. 

## Using these recipes

The easiest option is to copy-paste them into the top of programs you write, but there are more "elegant" ways. For example:
1. Suppose you're working on `asgn4.py`. 
2. Copy `eda.py` into the folder you're working on
3. In the section with your import statements, add `from eda import insufficient_but_starting_eda`
4. You can now use that function in your program!
